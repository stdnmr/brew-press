# Brew Press

My simple Aeropress recipe timer app.

The app just times the different steps for brewing coffee with an Aeropress for one specific method. 

## Method

The method assumed by the app uses the inverted method. Use 1 Aeropress scoop (about 15 grams) of medium/fine-ground coffee. Prepare the Aeropress by inverting it and fill in the ground.

## Timed steps

1. **Pour** in hot water up to top, but so that you can still stir without spilling.
2. **Stir** until all grounds are wet.
3. Let everything **steep**.
4. **Stir** again to mix water and grounds.
5. **Flip** on to a cup
6. **Plunge**.

The app is made primarily for my private use and still a work in progress.
